    "### Task Description\n",
    "<p>I need to write a python script which will scrape records from a website (each record has about ten text fields and two images which need to be downloaded to a local folder) and save all the text information to a pandas data frame along with the image file names. Each record on the website has a unique id in the url string which can be used as the index/primary key. I think using Selenium with ChromeDriver will be the easiest way to do this because I will have to login through the browser window and navigate to the main page and pick some options before starting the scraping loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the project will be to push the scraped information and images to my firebase project. Since each record has a unique identifier it should be pretty straight forward to use that as the primary key to save the text to firestore. Also the images will need to be uploaded to firebase storage and links to the images saved as a field in firestore for each record.</p>"

Decades of teaching experience. Are you ready to take your English to the next level -- and beyond -- with an experienced, enthusiastic teacher? I\\'m a certified TEFL instructor (teaching English as a foreign language), but I also taught college-level history for 25 years and taught music before that, so I have a wide range of teaching experiences and can discuss a wide variety of topics with advanced learners.\\nWhy choose Lori C.\\n\"Lori is an excellent tutor. I have been taking her class for quite a while. she can use many methods to teach, depending on you needs. often time during the class we would discuss different topics, and I learned idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly. she is also a good listener and very patient. I was very comfortable to practice conversation with her and not afraid of making mistakes, which was a huge plus. Personally, I highly recommend her to you.\"\\nGloria\\nNovember 7, 2021'}\n",
