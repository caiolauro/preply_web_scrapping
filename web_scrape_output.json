I like his methods, small tricks and strategies to remember grammar rules. We are spending a lot of time practising my conversational English during the lesson and after that we analyse what was said and what mistakes I made. It helps me to understand and memorise the grammar, to not cram it. I've remarked that my English speaking friends understand me better and it's easier to express my thoughts after our lessons. Highly recommended!\"\nStacey\nMarch 4, 2019"}]
